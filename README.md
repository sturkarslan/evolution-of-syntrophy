# evolution-of-syntrophy
Code and data related to analysis of genomics data for syntrophic community.

* 13 independent syntrophic microbial communities were evolved for 1000 generation and samples at different generations were sequenced.
* Sequence analysis was performed for variant calling by using pipeline of bwa, samtools, GATK and varscan
* Single cell lineage construction was done by using SCITE.
